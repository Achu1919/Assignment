    <p>One of the 108 Divya Desams, Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple is located in Thiruvananthapuram,
       the capital city of Kerala. Embellished in gold-plated covering, the temple is opened only to Hindu
        followers. Dedicated to Lord Padmanabha; one of the avatars of Lord Vishnu, the Padmanabhaswamy
         Temple is one of the principal centres of Vaishnava worship in the dharma of Vaishnavism. <br>
        <br>
        Built as a replica of the Adikesavaperumal Temple in Thiruvattar, the Padmanabhaswamy temple
         is well-preserved antiquity. Although the origin of this temple still remains a mystery, devotees
          believe it to have existed since the first day of the Kali Yuga, which was 5000 years ago.
           The Padmanabhaswamy temple also has a mention in the Bhagwad Gita. The scripture states that
            Balarama, the older brother of Lord Krishna frequented the temple, bathed in the Padmatheertham
             and also made several offerings the deity here. </p>
