    <p>Agastyakoodam, also known as Agastya Mala Peak is the second 
        highest peak in Kerala with an extensive height of 1868 metre. 
        ocated within the premises of Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary, 
        Agastyakoodam is part of the Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve 
        and boasts of surreal natural beauty. Nestled in Sahyadris of 
        Western Ghats, the slopes of the peak are carpeted in purple 
        hues of orchids. Home to diverse species of fauna and rare 
        species of medicinal herbs, the region is a hotspot for avifauna 
        and exotic birds. The spot is considered a haven for birdwatchers. 
        Besides, since it is a protected zone, you can spot nature at its 
        best, without any commercial interference. The colossal peak is 
        also a major Hindu pilgrimage spot for the devotees of the Hindu 
        sage Agastya, on whose name the peak has been named. There is also 
        a statue of him at the top where the Hindus can offer puja and 
        prayers.</p>
