    <h1>POOVAR</h1>
    <img src="Images/Poovar.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Poovar is a small rustic town situated 27 kms from Thiruvananthapuram with unspoilt,
         unexplored golden sand beaches and beautiful backwaters of Kerala.

        Also known as a fishing village, the tranquil Poovar island lies between the Arabian Sea
        and the Neyyar River. Hiring a boat, (especially during the sunset)that will take you through 
        the mangrove forest of backwaters is a must-do activity. The boat ride costs around INR 3000- INR 4000. The town has some of the beautiful resorts and hotels that are known for the hospitality they offer.
        
        Poovar beach is secluded and is only accessible by a boat. Swimming is allowed here throughout 
        the year except for the monsoon months</p>
